# Installation

We don't know if it works with linux, we don't have access to a computer running Linux and an NVIDIA card directly.

## Windows instructions

### If you own a NVIDIA GPU

You can install the CUDA toolkit and CUDNN versions 11.8 if you want to run the auto-taggers on your GPU, the app should work without it though, just slowly while using them.

You can follow this tutorial on how to install it:
