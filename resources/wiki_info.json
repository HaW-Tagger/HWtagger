The term [i]mono no aware[/i] (\u7269\u306e\u54c0\u308c, literally 'the pathos of things') was coined by 18th century scholar Motoori Norinaga to describe this concept as a theme found in classical Japanese literature, and associated it with the cherry blossom motif. \r\n\r\nThe white-colored autumn and winter blossoms (\u51ac\u685c, [i]fuyuzakura[/i]) of the higan cherry tree ([i]Prunus subhirtella autumnalis[/i]) are a notable variant, coming into bloom during those seasons. \r\n\r\nIn anime and manga, besides straightforward symbolization of youth and verve, the [[flower symbol|symbol]] may be used to denote gentle and/or affectionate characters; though this usage can sometimes be ironic. \r\n\r\nIn [[Touken Ranbu]], cherry blossoms indicate that a character has a [[gameplay mechanics|buff]].\r\n\r\n[[Cherry tree]]s in anime art are almost always drawn in bloom, but the actual cherries don't grow until the blossoms are long gone.

With heavy focus on the masculine features and appeal of [[mature male|men]]. \r\n\r\nWhile mostly dependent on an artist's personal tastes, the \u2018bara\u2019 archetype features 3 main body types:\r\n* Bear-type bodies, (typically tagged as [[plump]] or [[fat]]), are generally softer and rounder looking, with varying degrees of visible musculature.\r\n- Artists: [[Suv (suv032)|]], [[Kuro nezumi inu]], [[Tevit (tevit15)|]].\r\n\r\n* Hunks/Jocks or [[muscular|Muscular-type]] bodies, in contrast to the chiseled [[v-taper | triangular look]] of professional bodybuilders, have defined musculature that is usually more proportional overall, similar to that of athletic \"strongman\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongman], with a [[strongman waist | wider waist]] (\"comparison\":[https://cdn.donmai.us/original/e8/4f/e84f5efad6fd9ef1ff268d1982a564d6.jpg]), though the more [[shredded muscle | chiseled]] appearance can be a stylistic choice (see [[Nikism]] for reference).\r\n- Artists: [[Tarutoru]], [[Crow (siranui)|]], [[Dopey (dopq)|]].\r\n\r\n* Twunk or otter-type bodies, tagged [[toned]], [i]or[/i] [[muscular]] (especially with younger or sometimes older [[mature male]]s). \r\n- Artists: [[itto_(mentaiko)|Mentaiko]], [[Homri]], [[Torakichi (ebitendon)|]], [[Kuroshinki]]. \r\n\r\nMusculature, when depicted, is typically more exaggerated for emphasis (e.g. [[pectorals|pecs]]) along with the [[bulge]] (implying an exaggerated penis size), and both are usually rather noticeable even when the subject is wearing clothes -  abnormally so. When this exaggeration is paired with the points above, which assert a softer approach when drawing the male form, the 'bara' archetype becomes noticeable.\r\n\r\nCommon masculine features on subjects include: different degrees of [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]] (especially the [[navel hair|happy trail]] leading to [[male pubic hair|pubic hair]]) - or a complete absence of it in the case of younger characters (depending on the artist's tastes), [[thick eyebrows|thick]], [[eyebrow cut|cut]] or [[forked eyebrows|bushy eyebrows]], [[sideburns]], [[buzz cut]], [[large hands]], [[scar]]s, [[tattoo]]s, [[bandaid]]s, [[bandage]]s, [[wrinkled skin|wrinkles]] (visible with [[mature male|mature]] and [[old man|old]] men), etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these characteristics lend the style a degree of flexibility that allows for further stylization as well as broader cultural mixing between communities; for instance, despite bara\u2019s roots in opposition to them, there is substantial cross-over with the larger [[yaoi|Boys' Love]] community - which can be seen in some artists' styles (E.g [[Yotti]], [[Arima (arima_bn)|]]). It can also be applied to non-human and humanoid characters, such as [[furry male]]s  (E.g [[Wafu (youzora_samo18)|]], [[Boogbogex]]).\r\n\r\n[expand= History and meaning]\r\n\r\nThe word \"bara\" literally means \"rose\" in Japanese. The term originally comes from the magazine \"Barazoku\":[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barazoku], Japan's first gay men's magazine, with the term traditionally referring to more [[bishounen]]-esque men. As a result, the word \"bara\" also began being used as a slang term for any male homoerotic works in general (similar to the use of [[yaoi]] in the West).\r\n\r\nThe word \"bara\" as used here is primarily Western, stemming more from its application on art more commonly known as \"gei komi\", \"gei manga\", or \"mens love\" in Japan, a practice that began on Japanese imageboards, where they intentionally misappropriated the term, this interpretation later being exported abroad. Whilst some Japanese gei komi creators oppose the usage of \"bara\" due to its earlier legacy, others have embraced it. Note that, like most Manga Demographics, bara is commonly defined in terms of the target audience, not the authors or the subject matter.\r\n\r\nBara conceptually often contrasts with yaoi, which is gay male media traditionally made by heterosexual women to appeal to other heterosexual women. Whereas bara is gay/bi male media made by gay/bi men for gay/bi men, that generally features romantic and sexual relationships between [[muscular]] [[mature male|mature men]] and realistic(ish) relationships, often including LGBTQ issues, [[yaoi]] generally features androgynous, idealized, effeminate characters and melodramatic plots devoid of LGBTQ issues (like most [[yuri]], for similar root reasons). By its nature, it is also heteronormative, whether by stereotypically depicting overly emotional relationships or using concepts such as \"uke\" and \"seme,\" and includes themes of homosociality, which contributed more to the clash between fans of the two genres, though nowadays there's a grey area between the two. What they share in common the most though is the fact that non-Japanese audiences have misappropriated them, with yaoi having become a generalized weeb term for anything involving gay men.\r\n [/expand]", "grey skin": "Skin that is colored [[grey]].

These can be attached to and removed from the console at will, essentially making it a hybrid home/handheld platform.\r\n\r\nA smaller version, the [[nintendo switch lite|Switch Lite]], was revealed July 10th, 2019, built strictly for handheld gaming. The Lite has no detachable Joy-Cons; the controllers are hard-built into the console. It also has no HDMI output so cannot be connected to a TV like the original model Switch can. A [[nintendo switch - oled model|higher-end version]] featuring an OLED screen was released on October 8, 2021. \r\n\r\nThe platform has enjoyed a positive reception and high sales numbers in the years since its release. In addition to carrying many popular flagship titles like [[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild]] and [[Super Mario Odyssey]], the Switch has also become a welcoming home for many older games from last-gen systems. This led the Switch to be the [i]de facto[/i] portable way to play popular older titles like [[Diablo 3]], [[Dark Souls I]] and [[Castle Crashers]] which had previously only been playable on non-portable platforms. As of early 2023, the combined Switch product line is one of the best-selling platforms in Nintendo's entire history, outselling both the [[Wii]] and the [[Game Boy]] and now second only to the [[Nintendo DS]].\r\n\r\nFor tagging purposes, if the Switch has its Joy-Cons detached (or is being controlled by other compatible controllers), tag it as a [[game console]] (post #3259420, post #3528468).

The term describes an aesthetic that can be found in disparate areas in Asia: a teenage boy, around 13 to 18 years old, whose beauty (and sexual appeal) transcends the boundary of gender or sexual orientation. Bishounen characters are fairly common in manga and anime; a heavy number of male characters show subtle signs of the bishounen style, such as slender eyes or a feminine face. \r\n\r\nBishounen are usually drawn delicately, with long limbs, silky or flowing hair, and slender eyes with long eyelashes that can sometimes extend beyond the face. It's best to tag images that focus on the character's beauty, so there tends to be a heavier emphasis on solo or duo images here. Group images are fine, so long as the majority of the males exemplify this trait.\r\n\r\nAs the name suggests, the term is best used when you can still tell that the character is a male.
